-- OBJECTIVE 1: ENCOUNTERS OVERVIEW

-- a. How many total encounters occurred each year?
SELECT * FROM encounters;

SELECT COUNT(Id) AS total_encounters, YEAR(START) AS yr
FROM encounters
GROUP BY yr
ORDER BY yr;

-- b. For each year, what percentage of all encounters belonged to each encounter class
-- (ambulatory, outpatient, wellness, urgent care, emergency, and inpatient)?
SELECT YEAR(START) AS yr, 
	ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'ambulatory' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS ambulatory,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'outpatient' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS outpatient,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'wellness' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS wellness,

    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN ENCOUNTERCLASS = 'inpatient' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS inpatient

-- c. What percentage of encounters were over 24 hours versus under 24 hours?
SELECT * FROM encounters;

SELECT COUNT(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, START, STOP))
FROM encounters
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, START, STOP) >= 24;

SELECT COUNT(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, START, STOP))

FROM encounters;

-- OBJECTIVE 2: COST & COVERAGE INSIGHTS

-- a. How many encounters had zero payer coverage, and what percentage of total encounters does this represent?
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN PAYER_COVERAGE = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS zero_payer_coverage,
		COUNT(*) AS total_encounters,
        ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN PAYER_COVERAGE = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) AS pct_zero_payer_coverage

-- b. What are the top 10 most frequent procedures performed and the average base cost for each?
SELECT CODE, DESCRIPTION, COUNT(*) AS num_procedures, AVG(BASE_COST) AS avg_base_cost
FROM procedures
GROUP BY CODE, DESCRIPTION
ORDER BY num_procedures DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- c. What are the top 10 procedures with the highest average base cost and the number of times they were performed?
SELECT CODE, DESCRIPTION, AVG(BASE_COST) AS avg_base_cost, COUNT(*) AS num_procedures 
FROM procedures
GROUP BY CODE, DESCRIPTION
ORDER BY avg_base_cost DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- d. What is the average total claim cost for encounters, broken down by payer?
SELECT p.NAME, AVG(e.TOTAL_CLAIM_COST) AS avg_total_claim_cost
FROM payers p LEFT JOIN encounters e ON p.Id = e.PAYER
GROUP BY p.NAME
ORDER BY avg_total_claim_cost DESC;


-- OBJECTIVE 3: PATIENT BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS

-- a. How many unique patients were admitted each quarter over time?
SELECT YEAR(START) AS yr, QUARTER(START) AS qrtr, COUNT(DISTINCT PATIENT) AS num_unique_patients
FROM encounters 
GROUP BY yr, qrtr
ORDER BY yr, qrtr;

-- b. How many patients were readmitted within 30 days of a previous encounter?
SELECT PATIENT, START, STOP,
	LEAD (START) OVER(PARTITION BY PATIENT ORDER BY START) AS next_start_date
FROM encounters
ORDER BY PATIENT, START;

WITH cte AS (SELECT PATIENT, START, STOP,
			LEAD(START) OVER(PARTITION BY PATIENT ORDER BY START) AS next_start_date
            FROM encounters)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PATIENT) AS num_patients
FROM cte
WHERE DATEDIFF(next_start_date, STOP) < 30;

-- c. Which patients had the most readmissions?
WITH cte AS (SELECT PATIENT, START, STOP,
			LEAD(START) OVER(PARTITION BY PATIENT ORDER BY START) AS next_start_date
            FROM encounters)

SELECT PATIENT, COUNT(*) AS num_readmissions
FROM cte
