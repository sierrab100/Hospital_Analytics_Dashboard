# Hospital_Analytics_Dashboard
SQL, Tableau


## Objective:
The goal of this project was to visualize and analyze a hospitalâ€™s patient encounter data using Tableau. The objective was to uncover yearly trends, encounter class distributions, procedure costs, and payer coverage patterns to support data-driven decision-making in hospital operations and healthcare cost management.

Tools Used:

- SQL: Data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation of large healthcare claims datasets.

- Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation for interactive analysis and reporting.

## Process:

Data Preparation (SQL):

Queried and joined multiple tables containing cost, procedure, and patient data.

Calculated total and average out-of-pocket and payer coverage costs for each procedure.

Exported cleaned, summarized results for visualization.

Visualization & Insights (Tableau):

Created a side-by-side bar chart comparing out-of-pocket vs. payer coverage costs by procedure.

Applied sorting to rank procedures from highest to lowest average out-of-pocket cost.

Added KPI cards and legends to enhance interpretability.

Built an interactive dashboard to explore cost differences across procedures and patient types.

## Results:

## Key Insights:

### Encounters Overview

- Encounters increased steadily from 2011 to 2014, with a major spike in 2014 and another in 2021.

- The Ambulatory category consistently represented the largest share of encounters, peaking at 60.3% in 2014.

- Only 4.1% of encounters lasted more than 24 hours, suggesting most visits were short-term.

- Outpatient encounters notably rose in 2021 (40.2%), narrowing the gap with Ambulatory visits.

Dashboard Feature: Line charts and stacked bar visuals were used to show yearly encounter trends and category proportions with interactive tooltips.
