# Hospital_Analytics_Dashboard
SQL, Tableau


## Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze healthcare claim data to compare out-of-pocket costs and payer coverage costs across different medical procedures, helping identify which procedures place the greatest financial burden on patients.

Tools Used:

- SQL: Data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation of large healthcare claims datasets.

- Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard creation for interactive analysis and reporting.

## Process:

Data Preparation (SQL):

Queried and joined multiple tables containing cost, procedure, and patient data.

Calculated total and average out-of-pocket and payer coverage costs for each procedure.

Exported cleaned, summarized results for visualization.

Visualization & Insights (Tableau):

Created a side-by-side bar chart comparing out-of-pocket vs. payer coverage costs by procedure.

Applied sorting to rank procedures from highest to lowest average out-of-pocket cost.

Added KPI cards and legends to enhance interpretability.

Built an interactive dashboard to explore cost differences across procedures and patient types.

## Results:

## Key Insights:

Certain procedures showed significantly higher patient out-of-pocket costs despite similar payer coverage.

The dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly identify cost disparities and potential areas for financial policy review.

## Recommendations:
